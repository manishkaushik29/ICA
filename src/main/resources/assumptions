----------------------
For Business User access following points can be taken into consideration
1)First we need to define the semantic layer serving the Business users KPI's
2)Based on query performance acceptance ,Impala or Spark SQL,Hive can serve as semantic layer
3)Regarding user access to the semantic layer we can have multiple approaches
  a) We can authorize users to directly use semantic layer via Impala or Spark SQl based on role
  b) We can avoid direct access to semantic layer and can wrap Users KPI's under Api's (Flask)based on role
  c)Self service reporting layer can be created on BI tools like Tableau, PowerBI etc..
